# Curriculum

## Objectives

This round is an improvement of sorts refining the ideas from the previous round I completed last year, improving the parts I really liked about last round, and developing a streamlined curriculum of online courses mostly about various topics I'm curious about (hence "Mad Science"), and other topics that reinforce the skills relevant to my career.

My main task for this round remains the same: Complete as many of these courses as I can, making steady progress each day for the next 100 days. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Getting the _100% Complete_ status on the course, and thus acquiring the Certificate of Completion
- Completing the course projects

## Why Online Courses?

Honestly? Because it's fun! [I've done quite a few online courses last year](../Round%200/readme.md), and it tuned out to be something I very much enjoy. As such, I want to take the parts I liked about last round, refine these ideas into a curriculum of online courses, and pretty much just continue doing what I love and make lots of progress this year!

For this round, I've chosen exercise-driven courses for topics I don't know much about (or want to take a deeper dive in). To help myself come up with project ideas, something that I admittedly lack the skill (or creativity?) to do, I've also picked a bunch of project-based courses with some interesting and comprehensive projects that I can tweak to my liking as I learn more throughout this round. In the rare occasion that I actually come up with a project idea as I go through this round, I'll also make sure to add those to the Main Curriculum section below.

## Main Curriculum

### 1. ‚úÖ [Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/)

Starting the year off strong with this course! I'm really excited about the workshop format of this course, which is unlike any other video-based course I've seen so far.

Epic React also has a Typescript-based `next` branch for most of its workshops, and I do plan on checking those out and learn Typescript as I go along with the course.

#### Supplemental Resources

- ‚úÖ [Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/)

#### üíØ Extra Credit

- [freeCodeCamp - Front End Development Libraries Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#front-end-development-libraries-projects)
  - ‚úÖ [Build a Markdown Previewer](https://insidiae.github.io/markdown/markdown.html)
  - ‚úÖ [Build a Drum Machine](https://insidiae.github.io/drum/drum.html)

### 2. ‚úÖ [CSS for Javascript Developers](https://css-for-js.dev/)

This is another course with a somewhat different format to what I'm used to with Udemy courses. Combined with a solid course content, I have high hopes that this course will help me get even better with CSS!

#### Supplemental Resources

- ‚úÖ [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)

### 3. [Fullstack D3 and Data Visualization](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-d3)

After I finished the D3 section of [The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp) last year, I've always been intrigued by data visualization with D3. With this course, I hope to satisfy that curiosity about D3 and build some beautiful data visualization projects. Bonus points if I can combine React with D3 to make the visualizations interactive as well!

#### Supplemental Resources

- [freeCodeCamp - Data Visualization Certification Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/)

#### üíØ Extra Credit

- Redo projects using React + D3

### 4. Major Project - TBA
