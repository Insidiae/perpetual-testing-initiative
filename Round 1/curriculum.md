## Why Online Courses?

[I've done quite a few online courses last year](../Round%200/readme.md), and it tuned out to be something I very much enjoy. (...TODO)

For this round, I've chosen exercise-heavy courses for topics I don't know much about (or want to take a deeper dive in). To help myself come up with project ideas, something that I admittedly lack the skill (or creativity?) to do, I've also picked a bunch of project-based courses with some interesting and comprehensive projects that I can tweak to my liking as I learn more throughout this round. In the rare occasion that I actually come up with a project idea as I go through this round, I'll also make sure to add those to the Main Curriculum section below.
