# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, February 1st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's React Fundamentals workshop.

**Thoughts:** What an insanely productive first day so start the year off! I started the Epic React course and had so much fun doing the first workshop and finished it in one session. The workshop format really adds a huge amount of value to the course, and I can tell this is going to be a course that will end up taking several times longer than its advertised total video length. So much information jam-packed within bite-sized videos to supplement the workshops!

### Day 2: Wednesday, February 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the `next` branch of Epic React's React Fundamentals workshop.

**Thoughts:** Doing the `next` branch workshop exercises was a great way to reinforce what I just learned as well as pick up some TypeScript skills along the way. I'm already quite interested in using TypeScript for my future React projects, but I still feel like I might have to take a short detour and dive deeper into TypeScript in order to appreciate what we do in these TypeScript-based exercises a bit more.
