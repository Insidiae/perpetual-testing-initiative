# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, February 1st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's React Fundamentals workshop.

**Thoughts:** What an insanely productive first day so start the year off! I started the Epic React course and had so much fun doing the first workshop and finished it in one session. The workshop format really adds a huge amount of value to the course, and I can tell this is going to be a course that will end up taking several times longer than its advertised total video length. So much information jam-packed within bite-sized videos to supplement the workshops!

### Day 2: Wednesday, February 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the `next` branch of Epic React's React Fundamentals workshop.

**Thoughts:** Doing the `next` branch workshop exercises was a great way to reinforce what I just learned as well as pick up some TypeScript skills along the way. I'm already quite interested in using TypeScript for my future React projects, but I still feel like I might have to take a short detour and dive deeper into TypeScript in order to appreciate what we do in these TypeScript-based exercises a bit more.

### Day 3: Thursday, February 3rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's React Hooks workshop.

**Thoughts:** This is only the 2nd module of the course, yet it already covers about 90% of what I know about React 😅 Looking forward to learning so much more in the following workshops!

### Day 4: Friday, February 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the `next` branch exercises in Epic React's React Hooks workshop.

**Thoughts:** Got a bit more practice in TypeScript by converting the exercises from JS to TS. Still need to get more practice to apply the correct types on stuff

### Day 5: Saturday, February 5th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's Advanced React Hooks workshop.

**Thoughts:** Learned some more situational React Hooks, and got more practice writing reusable custom hooks. We also implemented this amazing [useAsync hook](https://usehooks.com/useAsync/) from scratch!

### Day 6: Sunday, February 6th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the `next` branch exercises in Epic React's Advanced React Hooks workshop.

**Thoughts:** Converting my exercise solutions to TypeScript is fun and all, but I think I'd like to learn more about TypeScript first before getting to the good parts of the Epic React course.

### Day 7: Monday, February 7th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Design Patterns sections of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Refreshed my current knowledge of TypeScript today. I'm loving how well TypeScript integrates with VSCode, providing static analysis and autocomplete that makes writing code a lot easier and faster too!

**Link to work:** [Course progress repo - TypeScript Levelgrind](https://github.com/Insidiae/typescript-levelgrind)

### Day 8: Tuesday, February 8th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Reusable Code section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Having prior experience with C# definitely helps me make sense of most of TypeScript's features covered in the course. Learning the same topics now feels even more valuable because I can actually see where to apply them in real-world projects.

**Link to work:** [TypeScript Levelgrind](https://github.com/Insidiae/typescript-levelgrind)

### Day 9: Wednesday, February 9th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the Build a Web Framework section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** The major project is a pretty large section of the course, so I just did the first half today and set up the boilerplate for the project. Finishing this up tomorrow!

**Link to work:** [TypeScript Web Framework Project (WIP)](https://github.com/Insidiae/typescript-levelgrind/tree/web-framework/web)

### Day 10: Thursday, February 10th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Build a Web Framework section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Implementing the basic components needed to build a simple web application using TypeScript in this course project provides some valuable insight into how (relatively old) web frameworks work. I'm actually pretty certain I could build the usual Todo List project using this web framework we just made in the course. Pretty good stuff!

**Link to work:** [TypeScript Levelgrind](https://github.com/Insidiae/typescript-levelgrind)

### Day 11: Friday, February 11th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Express + TypeScript integration section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Turns out this was just the first half of two sections dealing with integrating Express with TypeScript, focusing mostly on setting up a barebones Express server that we'll fully integrate with modern TypeScript features in the next section. Finishing this up tomorrow then!

**Link to work:** [Express + TypeScript section project (WIP)](https://github.com/Insidiae/typescript-levelgrind/tree/express-typescript/server)

### Day 12: Saturday, February 12th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Advanced Express + TypeScript integration section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Huh, using TypeScript decorators cleaned up our Express code from yesterday pretty well! I dig the class-based format making the route handler code somewhat easier to read through and parse which methods/middlewares/validators go in each route.

**Link to work:** [Express + TypeScript section project (Done!)](https://github.com/Insidiae/typescript-levelgrind/tree/main/server)

### Day 13: Sunday, February 13th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the React and Redux with Typescript section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide, **and earned the course completion certificate.**.

**Thoughts:** Aaannd we've finally gone full circle! I finally got to know how to properly integrate TypeScript with my React projects, and getting a bit more experience refactoring the section project with modern Redux (using Redux Toolkit) is really awesome!

Alright, that concludes my TypeScript Levelgrind. Now we shall get back to working on the Epic React course!

### Day 14: Monday, February 14th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's Advanced React Patterns workshop.

**Thoughts:** Alright, time to jump right back into these Epic React workshops! And right into the good parts as well - Today's workshop is exactly what it says on the tin, I'm adding these React patterns to my personal toolkit so I can apply them to my projects later!

**Link to work:** [Epic React Checkpoints - Advanced React Patterns](https://github.com/Insidiae/epic-react-checkpoints/tree/main/04-advanced-react-patterns)

### Day 15: Tuesday, February 15th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the `next` branch exercises in Epic React's Advanced React Patterns workshop.

**Thoughts:** The `next` branch exersises went a lot more smoothly this time thanks to my time spent learning TypeScript! Also thanks to TypeScript, some of the exercises became simpler because we don't need to bother with manual type checking anymore!

**Link to work:** [Epic React Checkpoints - Advanced React Patterns](https://github.com/Insidiae/epic-react-checkpoints/tree/main/04-advanced-react-patterns)

### Day 16: Wednesday, February 16th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's React Performance workshop.

**Thoughts:** The React Performance workshop was a lot of material to go through, but boy did I learn a lot today! From tiny gotchas I didn't even notice when writing my usual React code, to really useful optimization tricks to add to my toolbelt, this workshop has it all 🔥

**Link to work:** [Epic React Checkpoints - React Performance](https://github.com/Insidiae/epic-react-checkpoints/blob/main/05-react-performance)

### Day 17: Thursday, February 17th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's Testing React Apps workshop.

**Thoughts:** The entire time I'm working through this workshop, I'm always blown away by how much simpler the tests are than what I expected. I love how React Testing Library and MSW make testing React applications super intuitive and easy to understand even for total beginners like me!

**Link to work:** [Epic React Checkpoints - Testing React Apps](https://github.com/Insidiae/epic-react-checkpoints/tree/main/06-testing-react-apps)

### Day 18: Friday, February 18th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's Testing React Apps workshop.

**Thoughts:** Today went a LOT smoother than expected! Funny how most of what I had to do for the next branch exercises was pretty much "lmao just copy paste everything then upgrade your code to TypeScript" 🔥

This also goes to show exactly why using modern libraries is great - most of them have great type defs built in so the upgrade process is pretty minimal 👌

### Day 19: Saturday, February 19th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's React Suspense workshop.

**Thoughts:** This workshop was a fun glimpse into what's in store for React as we check out the experimental features of React Suspense API. Really fun stuff dealing with "Render-as-you-fetch", super excited to see how this evolves in future versions of React!

**Link to work:** [Epic React Checkpoints - React Suspense](https://github.com/Insidiae/epic-react-checkpoints/tree/main/07-react-suspense)

### Day 20: Sunday, February 20th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished freeCodeCamp's Build a Markdown Previewer project.

**Thoughts:** I'm a fair bit ahead of schedule, so I'm doing some freeCodeCamp projects as an Extra Credit for this challenge. This one's just a quick n' easy project to get me going for bigger projects!

**Link to work:** [freeCodeCamp - Markdown Previewer project](https://insidiae.github.io/markdown/markdown.html)

### Day 21: Monday, February 21st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished freeCodeCamp's Build a Drum Machine project, **_and earned the Front End Development Libraries certification_**.

**Thoughts:** Absolutely breezed through getting this project to work using React, to the point where I spend 3x more time making the project look presentable 😅

But with this, I've completed the last project I need for this freeCodeCamp certification!

### Day 23: Friday, February 25th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Part 2/4 of Epic React's Build an Epic React App workshop.

**Thoughts:** It's awesome to see myself go from knowing absolutely nothing about making custom React Hooks to casually making a bunch of them just to spare myself from copypasting code across multiple files 🔥

We also used React Query in today's workshop. It's another awesome library that solves my frustrations on dealing with server-side data!

### Day 26: Monday, March 7th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Module 1 lessons in CSS for Javascript Developers.

**Thoughts:** Alright, it's time for the next course on my list! The CSS for Javascript Developers course is another one with a different format than what I'm used to, but I'm really digging it so far!

A quick peek at the course outline tells me that I can divvy up each module into two parts: I can binge the module lessons first and then do the workshop in a separate session. I also have quite a few supplementary resources (aka other project-based CSS courses) that I'll also be taking as I make progress though this course as an attempt to solidify my learnings in this one.

Looking forward to getting even better at CSS with this course!

**Link to work:** N/A, all progress was done through the course platform!

### Day 27: Tuesday, March 8th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Module 1 workshop in CSS for Javascript Developers.

**Thoughts:** Not bad for my first workshop! The design tokens provided in the starter files eliminated most of the guesswork and I can pretty much eyeball my design implementation with little adjustment when comparing against the solution.

**Link to work:** [Workshop 1: Huckleberry Agency Website](https://github.com/Insidiae/huckleberry)

### Day 28: Wednesday, March 9th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Module 2 lessons in CSS for Javascript Developers.

**Thoughts:** Pretty chill session today. The course platform's puzzle minigames are a great change of pace and is a more fun approach for demonstrating the topics presented in the course.

**Link to work:** N/A, all progress was done through the course platform!

### Day 29: Thursday, March 10th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Module 2 workshop in CSS for Javascript Developers.

**Thoughts:** Pretty fun workshop today! I like how the exercises make us comfortable with scrollbars + fixed/absolute positioning while still writing CSS that actually make sense. Adjusting the styles for mobile screens was also a great extra challenge. Great stuff!

### Day 30: Friday, March 11th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Module 3 lessons in CSS for Javascript Developers.

**Thoughts:** Another pretty chill session today. (Re-)learned the basics of Styled Components and how its concepts apply to virtually any component-based design system.

**Link to work:** N/A, all progress was done through the course platform!

### Day 31: Saturday, March 12th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Module 3 workshop in CSS for Javascript Developers.

**Thoughts:** Having a more challenging exercise with Styled Components is already pretty cool, but the components we build in this workshop are also great! Picked up some nifty styling tricks up my sleeve for making some of these custom components in my own projects.

**Link to work:** [Workshop 3: Mini Component Library](https://github.com/Insidiae/mini-component-library)

### Day 32: Monday, March 14th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Components and Layout Patterns section in Jonas Schmedtmann's HTML and CSS course.

**Thoughts:** Doing Jonas' HTML+CSS course for more exercises + project fun, and also applying what I learn by building the exercises with React + Styled Components.

Today's highlight is the Accordion Component, made interactive with the (Flexible) Compound Components pattern and using CSS variables to easily apply dynamic styles with Styled Components!

### Day 33: Tuesday, March 15th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Module 4 lessons in CSS for Javascript Developers.

**Thoughts:** Today's basically just a review of Flexbox for me, and I'm glad to say that I've still got it, baby! I did also pick up some nifty tricks from the module exercises and improved my overall understanding of Flexbox as a whole.

**Link to work:** N/A, all progress was done through the course platform!

### Day 34: Wednesday, March 16th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Module 4 workshop in CSS for Javascript Developers.

**Thoughts:** For the most part, the workshop went incredibly smoothly thanks to my previous experience with Flexbox. There were quite a few subtle design and layout tricks I picked up, and will certainly explore more on my next projects!

**Link to work:** [Workshop 4: Sole&Ankle](https://github.com/Insidiae/sole-and-ankle)

### Day 35: Thursday, March 17th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the CSS Floats and Flexbox sections in Jonas Schmedtmann's HTML and CSS course.

**Thoughts:** Did another round of Flexbox exercises as an added challenge. We also got to compare some difference between the CSS Float and Flexbox layouts. As an added challenge, I also did the demo project using TypeScript this time. I really like how TypeScript checks the custom CSS Variables I set to ensure that resuable components that depend on those CSS variables work correctly!

**Link to work:** [CSS Float and Flexbox Layouts Demo](https://github.com/Insidiae/jonas-html-css-course/tree/main/css-layouts)

### Day 36: Friday, March 18th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Module 5 in CSS for Javascript Developers.

**Thoughts:** Had a bit more time today, so I finished the whole module in one go! It's one thing to know how to use media queries for responsive stuff, but this module also introduces fluid design systems to implement subtle-looking yet surprisingly tricky details ♥️

### Day 38: Saturday, March 26th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Web Design Rules and Framework section in Jonas Schmedtmann's HTML and CSS course.

**Thoughts:** Got stumped on an unrelated but really tricky TypeScript issue when setting up the section project, so I took my time to complete this section 😅

Setup hiccups aside, the web design section itself was a breeze to go through, with tons of design examples to take inspirations from 🔥

**Link to work:** [Web Design section demo](https://github.com/Insidiae/jonas-html-css-course/blob/main/web-design)

### Day 39: Sunday, March 27th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Module 7 in CSS for Javascript Developers.

**Thoughts:** I already have a bit of experience with CSS Grid, but this module did give me more CSS Grid tricks such as scrollable grid content with sticky sidebars, and that border trick as seen in the workshop 🔥

**Link to work:** [Workshop 7: New Grid Times](https://github.com/Insidiae/new-grid-times)

### Day 40: Monday, March 28th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Module 8 in CSS for Javascript Developers.

**Thoughts:** This module is tons of fun to work through! Learned the ins and outs of how animations work in CSS. I also like the more open-ended nature of the workshop where we can explore different animation styles for the components. Great stuff!

**Link to work:** [Workshop 8: Sole&Ankle, Animated](https://github.com/Insidiae/sole-and-ankle-animated)

### Day 41: Tuesday, March 29th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Module 9 in CSS for Javascript Developers, **and earned the course completion certificate.**

**Thoughts:** Woohoo! That's my 2nd main course checked off for this round. I can proudly say that the #CSSforJS course helped me be a lot more confident with the CSS I write!

**Link to work:** N/A, all progress was done through the course platform!

### Day 42: Wednesday, March 30th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the Omnifood final project in Jonas Schmedtmann's HTML and CSS course.

**Thoughts:** I decided to work with SASS for this project and wow, my workflow was blazing fast and extremely organized! I also applied the modern CSS stuff I learned and started using CSS variables for reusable properties and HSL colors instead of plain ol' hexcodes.

**Link to work:** [Omnifood](https://insidiae.github.io/advanced-css-and-sass/Omnifood/index.html)

### Day 43: Thursday, March 31st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Omnifood final project in Jonas Schmedtmann's HTML and CSS course, **and earned the course completion certificate.**

### Day 45: Thursday, April 21st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Remade my personal portfolio webpage.

**Thoughts:** This took quite a while to make! I spent most of the time just figuring out a general layout and design that looks good enough, but at least my newfound CSS skills let me implement my design fairly easily!

**Link to work:** [My Portfolio](https://insidiae.github.io)

### Day 46: Saturday, April 23rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the freeCodeCamp Technical Documentation Page project.

**Thoughts:** I've been planning to create a full-on documentation page out of my JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures notes, and I'm glad to say that this proof-of-concept turned out really well! I was able to whip up most of the layout _blazing fast_ using Bootstrap, and I spiced up my notes using syntax highlighting from Highlight.js, and added some neat diagrams using Mermaid.js. I just need to add the content and I can turn this in for the freeCodeCamp certification!

**Link to work:** [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Documentation](https://insidiae.github.io/js-algos-and-data-structs)

### Day 47: Monday, April 25th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Technical Documentation Page project, **_and earned the Responsive Web Design Certification_**.

**Thoughts:** After all this time, I've finally earned the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification!

This Technical Documentation Page project was a lot of fun to build, from setting up a basic navigation layout with Bootstrap, creating awesome syntax highlighting with Highlight.js and fancy diagrams with Mermaid.js. Actually adding in the content for the page ended up being a lot of work, but the amount of content I added into the project was worth it and represents all the topics I learned in the Data Structures and Algorithms courses I've taken. It's really awesome to see just how far I've gotten on my learning journey!

### Day 54: Wednesday, May 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Module 3 of the Fullstack D3 Masterclass.

**Thoughts:** It's time to make our charts even fancier by adding transitions + animations! I loved today's exercise where we created a cool bubble-up animation on scatterplot dots ❤️

**Link to work:** [Fullstack D3 - Module 3](https://github.com/Insidiae/fullstack-d3/tree/main/03-animations-and-transitions)

### Day 55: Thursday, May 5th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Module 4 of the Fullstack D3 Masterclass.

**Thoughts:** Today's module lessons demonstrate a fairly simple example, but it shows that adding something that's straightforward in one type of chart (such as tooltips) can be a lot trickier to implement in other types of charts.

**Link to work:** [Fullstack D3 - Module 4](https://github.com/Insidiae/fullstack-d3/tree/main/04-interactions)

### Day 56: Friday, May 6th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Module 5 of the Fullstack D3 Masterclass.

**Thoughts:** Improved the fancy scatterplot from last time and used a more accessible color scheme, added legends to indicate the penguin species, and added linear regression lines for each species group, making the chart more closely resemble the original example.

### Day 57: Saturday, May 7th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Module 6 of the Fullstack D3 Masterclass.

**Thoughts:** Today's project is a big one! We put out dataviz skills we learned from the previous modules in this project, making the most of the provided dataset to build this beautiful radar chart.

### Day 58: Sunday, May 8th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Module 7 of the Fullstack D3 Masterclass.

**Thoughts:** And with the final section all about using D3 with JS frameworks like React, that wraps up the Masterclass! Up next, I'll be doing a couple more D3 projects before doing a re-run of the Fullstack D3 book using React + D3.

### Day 59: Monday, May 9th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Bar Chart project.

**Thoughts:** Time to do some real D3.js projects to apply what I learned from the Fullstack D3 course! For this first one I was able to quickly get a nice bar chart up and running by just slightly tweaking one of the course exercises. The modern D3 workflow I learned from the Fullstack D3 course worked wonders for this project!

### Day 60: Tuesday, May 10th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Scatterplot project.

**Thoughts:** It's truly amazing how a genericized workflow helps massively for these projects! I really only needed to change some line of code for the new dataset coming in but the overall logic remains the same 🔥

### Day 61: Wednesday, May 11th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Heat Map project.

**Thoughts:** Oh hey, it's a completely new chart type than what I've built so far! Fortunately, the same step-by-step D3 workflow still makes working with the dataset a lot easier and helps me get this Heat Map up and running really fast!

### Day 62: Thursday, May 12th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Choropleth Map project.

**Thoughts:** This one's more of a refresher! I re-familiarized myself with GeoJSON/TopoJSON and updated my previous workflow for displaying map data into the new D3 workflow that I recently learned.

### Day 63: Friday, May 13th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Treemap project, **_and earned the Data Visualization Certification_**.

**Thoughts:** What a way to finish off this series of projects! This one had a slightly different approach to displaying data using the d3-hierarchy module. But hey, everything else still works great with the usual D3 workflow 💪

### Day 64: Saturday, May 14th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built the Marginal Histogram project from the Fullstack D3 book.

**Thoughts:** Just a couple more extra projects from the Fullstack D3 book before I wrap up! Today's project is another advanced dataviz exercise spicing up the old Scatterplot into a beautiful Marginal Histogram.

### Day 65: Sunday, May 15th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built the Animated Sankey Diagram project from the Fullstack D3 book.

**Thoughts:** One last complex data visualization project from the Fullstack D3 book! We take a simple dataset relating gender + socioeconomic status to educational attainment and use it to generate random data to populate an Animated Sankey Diagram.

### Day 66: Monday, May 16th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Ported the rest of the common chart examples from the Fullstack D3 book.

**Thoughts:** Just tying up some loose ends today, porting the other common chart examples before I redo every exercise using React + D3.

### Day 67: Wednesday, May 18th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Remade Chapter 1 of the Fullstack D3 book using React.

**Thoughts:** Time to put my skills to the test by remaking the previous D3 lessons using React + TypeScript! So far the toughest roadblock I'm facing is learning the D3 typedefs and wrangling my accessor + scale functions 🤯

### Day 68: Saturday, May 21st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Remade Chapter 2 of the Fullstack D3 book using React.

**Thoughts:** Cleaned up my typings for the data + accessor functions, ported another dataviz exercise into React + D3 + Typescript, and tweaked my custom axis ticks to make the charts exactly like the original examples. Now my React port of the step-by-step D3 workflow is starting to make sense 🤓

### Day 69: Wednesday, July 13th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Remade Chapter 3 of the Fullstack D3 book using React.

**Thoughts:** Been a while since I worked on this! Making the histogram reusable for different metrics was a bit tricky especially with adding proper TypeScript types, but the rest became surprisingly intuitive after referencing my past code and simply rewriting them into React!

### Day 70: Wednesday, July 20th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Remade Chapter 4 of the Fullstack D3 book using React.

**Thoughts:** React-Spring's API for animations and transitions definitely took some time to get used to, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly after creating a small sample project to get a feel of how to make the APIs work and then using the same concepts in the actual project!

### Day 71: Saturday, July 23rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Remade Chapter 5 of the Fullstack D3 book using React.

**Thoughts:** Took some time to clean up my code a bit, and it paid off really well! I was able to set up interactions (tooltips, event handlers, etc.) to the previous charts a lot quicker now that I have much less code bloat to deal with.

### Day 72: Sunday, July 24th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Remade Chapter 7 of the Fullstack D3 book using React.

**Thoughts:** Just skipped ahead to the Dataviz Basics chapter for now! I feel like I'm getting the hang of the React + D3 workflow now, since really the trickiest part of porting this chapter's code to React + TypeScript is using proper types for the functions I ported.

### Day 73: Monday, July 25th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Remade Chapter 11 of the Fullstack D3 book using React.

**Thoughts:** Alright, I finally converted all exercises from the Masterclass into React + TypeScript! There's only a few extra charts from the book, as well as a few more major projects that I need to port before I can call this project 100% complete, but I'm feeling pretty good with this progress so far!
