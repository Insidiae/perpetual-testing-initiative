# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, February 1st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's React Fundamentals workshop.

**Thoughts:** What an insanely productive first day so start the year off! I started the Epic React course and had so much fun doing the first workshop and finished it in one session. The workshop format really adds a huge amount of value to the course, and I can tell this is going to be a course that will end up taking several times longer than its advertised total video length. So much information jam-packed within bite-sized videos to supplement the workshops!

### Day 2: Wednesday, February 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the `next` branch of Epic React's React Fundamentals workshop.

**Thoughts:** Doing the `next` branch workshop exercises was a great way to reinforce what I just learned as well as pick up some TypeScript skills along the way. I'm already quite interested in using TypeScript for my future React projects, but I still feel like I might have to take a short detour and dive deeper into TypeScript in order to appreciate what we do in these TypeScript-based exercises a bit more.

### Day 3: Thursday, February 3rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's React Hooks workshop.

**Thoughts:** This is only the 2nd module of the course, yet it already covers about 90% of what I know about React ðŸ˜… Looking forward to learning so much more in the following workshops!

### Day 4: Friday, February 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the `next` branch exercises in Epic React's React Hooks workshop.

**Thoughts:** Got a bit more practice in TypeScript by converting the exercises from JS to TS. Still need to get more practice to apply the correct types on stuff

### Day 5: Saturday, February 5th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's Advanced React Hooks workshop.

**Thoughts:** Learned some more situational React Hooks, and got more practice writing reusable custom hooks. We also implemented this amazing [useAsync hook](https://usehooks.com/useAsync/) from scratch!

### Day 6: Sunday, February 6th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the `next` branch exercises in Epic React's Advanced React Hooks workshop.

**Thoughts:** Converting my exercise solutions to TypeScript is fun and all, but I think I'd like to learn more about TypeScript first before getting to the good parts of the Epic React course.

### Day 7: Monday, February 7th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Design Patterns sections of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Refreshed my current knowledge of TypeScript today. I'm loving how well TypeScript integrates with VSCode, providing static analysis and autocomplete that makes writing code a lot easier and faster too!

### Day 8: Tuesday, February 8th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Reusable Code section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Having prior experience with C# definitely helps me make sense of most of TypeScript's features covered in the course. Learning the same topics now feels even more valuable because I can actually see where to apply them in real-world projects.

### Day 9: Wednesday, February 9th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the Build a Web Framework section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** The major project is a pretty large section of the course, so I just did the first half today and set up the boilerplate for the project. Finishing this up tomorrow!

### Day 10: Thursday, February 10th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Build a Web Framework section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Implementing the basic components needed to build a simple web application using TypeScript in this course project provides some valuable insight into how (relatively old) web frameworks work. I'm actually pretty certain I could build the usual Todo List project using this web framework we just made in the course. Pretty good stuff!

### Day 11: Friday, February 11th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Express + TypeScript integration section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Turns out this was just the first half of two sections dealing with integrating Express with TypeScript, focusing mostly on setting up a barebones Express server that we'll fully integrate with modern TypeScript features in the next section. Finishing this up tomorrow then!

### Day 12: Saturday, February 12th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Advanced Express + TypeScript integration section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Huh, using TypeScript decorators cleaned up our Express code from yesterday pretty well! I dig the class-based format making the route handler code somewhat easier to read through and parse which methods/middlewares/validators go in each route.

### Day 13: Sunday, February 13th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the React and Redux with Typescript section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide, **and earned the course completion certificate.**.

**Thoughts:** Aaannd we've finally gone full circle! I finally got to know how to properly integrate TypeScript with my React projects, and getting a bit more experience refactoring the section project with modern Redux (using Redux Toolkit) is really awesome!

Alright, that concludes my TypeScript Levelgrind. Now we shall get back to working on the Epic React course!

### Day 14: Monday, February 14th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's Advanced React Patterns workshop.

**Thoughts:** Alright, time to jump right back into these Epic React workshops! And right into the good parts as well - Today's workshop is exactly what it says on the tin, I'm adding these React patterns to my personal toolkit so I can apply them to my projects later!

### Day 15: Tuesday, February 15th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the `next` branch exercises in Epic React's Advanced React Patterns workshop.

**Thoughts:** The `next` branch exersises went a lot more smoothly this time thanks to my time spent learning TypeScript! Also thanks to TypeScript, some of the exercises became simpler because we don't need to bother with manual type checking anymore!

### Day 16: Wednesday, February 16th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's React Performance workshop.

**Thoughts:** The React Performance workshop was a lot of material to go through, but boy did I learn a lot today! From tiny gotchas I didn't even notice when writing my usual React code, to really useful optimization tricks to add to my toolbelt, this workshop has it all ðŸ”¥

### Day 17: Thursday, February 17th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's Testing React Apps workshop.

**Thoughts:** The entire time I'm working through this workshop, I'm always blown away by how much simpler the tests are than what I expected. I love how React Testing Library and MSW make testing React applications super intuitive and easy to understand even for total beginners like me!

### Day 18: Friday, February 18th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's Testing React Apps workshop.

**Thoughts:** Today went a LOT smoother than expected! Funny how most of what I had to do for the next branch exercises was pretty much "lmao just copy paste everything then upgrade your code to TypeScript" ðŸ”¥

This also goes to show exactly why using modern libraries is great - most of them have great type defs built in so the upgrade process is pretty minimal ðŸ‘Œ

### Day 19: Saturday, February 19th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's React Suspense workshop.

**Thoughts:** This workshop was a fun glimpse into what's in store for React as we check out the experimental features of React Suspense API. Really fun stuff dealing with "Render-as-you-fetch", super excited to see how this evolves in future versions of React!

### Day 20: Sunday, February 20th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished freeCodeCamp's Build a Markdown Previewer project.

**Thoughts:** I'm a fair bit ahead of schedule, so I'm doing some freeCodeCamp projects as an Extra Credit for this challenge. This one's just a quick n' easy project to get me going for bigger projects!
