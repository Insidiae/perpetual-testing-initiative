# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, February 1st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's React Fundamentals workshop.

**Thoughts:** What an insanely productive first day so start the year off! I started the Epic React course and had so much fun doing the first workshop and finished it in one session. The workshop format really adds a huge amount of value to the course, and I can tell this is going to be a course that will end up taking several times longer than its advertised total video length. So much information jam-packed within bite-sized videos to supplement the workshops!

### Day 2: Wednesday, February 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the `next` branch of Epic React's React Fundamentals workshop.

**Thoughts:** Doing the `next` branch workshop exercises was a great way to reinforce what I just learned as well as pick up some TypeScript skills along the way. I'm already quite interested in using TypeScript for my future React projects, but I still feel like I might have to take a short detour and dive deeper into TypeScript in order to appreciate what we do in these TypeScript-based exercises a bit more.

### Day 3: Thursday, February 3rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's React Hooks workshop.

**Thoughts:** This is only the 2nd module of the course, yet it already covers about 90% of what I know about React ðŸ˜… Looking forward to learning so much more in the following workshops!

### Day 4: Friday, February 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the `next` branch exercises in Epic React's React Hooks workshop.

**Thoughts:** Got a bit more practice in TypeScript by converting the exercises from JS to TS. Still need to get more practice to apply the correct types on stuff

### Day 5: Saturday, February 5th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Epic React's Advanced React Hooks workshop.

**Thoughts:** Learned some more situational React Hooks, and got more practice writing reusable custom hooks. We also implemented this amazing [useAsync hook](https://usehooks.com/useAsync/) from scratch!

### Day 6: Sunday, February 6th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the `next` branch exercises in Epic React's Advanced React Hooks workshop.

**Thoughts:** Converting my exercise solutions to TypeScript is fun and all, but I think I'd like to learn more about TypeScript first before getting to the good parts of the Epic React course.

### Day 7: Monday, February 7th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Design Patterns sections of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Refreshed my current knowledge of TypeScript today. I'm loving how well TypeScript integrates with VSCode, providing static analysis and autocomplete that makes writing code a lot easier and faster too!

### Day 8: Tuesday, February 8th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Reusable Code section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Having prior experience with C# definitely helps me make sense of most of TypeScript's features covered in the course. Learning the same topics now feels even more valuable because I can actually see where to apply them in real-world projects.

### Day 9: Wednesday, February 9th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the Build a Web Framework section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** The major project is a pretty large section of the course, so I just did the first half today and set up the boilerplate for the project. Finishing this up tomorrow!

### Day 10: Thursday, February 10th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Build a Web Framework section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Implementing the basic components needed to build a simple web application using TypeScript in this course project provides some valuable insight into how (relatively old) web frameworks work. I'm actually pretty certain I could build the usual Todo List project using this web framework we just made in the course. Pretty good stuff!

### Day 11: Friday, February 11th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Express + TypeScript integration section of Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide.

**Thoughts:** Turns out this was just the first half of two sections dealing with integrating Express with TypeScript, focusing mostly on setting up a barebones Express server that we'll fully integrate with modern TypeScript features in the next section. Finishing this up tomorrow then!
