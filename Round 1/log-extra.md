# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 Extras

### Extra Day 1: Tuesday, February 22nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Reached Silver Level in Stackleague.

**Thoughts:** I've been super excited for Stackleague's official launch today! I'm still a bit ahead of schedule for this month, so I cleared the Bronze and Silver Level challenges for now. Let's see if I can clear the Gold Level challenge tomorrow!

### Extra Day 2: Wednesday, February 23rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Reached Gold Level in Stackleague.

**Thoughts:** Alright, I think that wraps up the Stackeague Challenger Level Up event for me! As always, I'm glad to see my DSA skills I've been improving since last year being put to the test and succeeding!

### Extra Day 3: Monday, February 28th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Binged the Epic React Expert Interviews.

**Thoughts:** Since I have an extra day left after finishing Epic React, I figured just chilling while listening to the Epic React Expert Interviews is a great way to wrap up this month. Firing up the next course after a short break!
