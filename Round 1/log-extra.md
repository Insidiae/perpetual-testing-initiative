### Extra Day 4: Sunday, April 3rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made a nice README.md for my Github profile.

**Thoughts:** Finally caved in and followed some tutorials to make one of those fancy-looking Github profile READMEs I've been seeing a lot of recently. It was quite fun to take a step back and evaluate the technologies I've worked on so far!

### Extra Day 7: Monday, April 25th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Attended the Prisma + MongoDB Basic Workshop workshop in the Prisma + MongoDB Launch Week.
