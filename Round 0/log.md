ins# 100 Days Of Code - Round 0 Log

### Day 0: Monday, May 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did some prep work for the 100 Days of Code challenge, outlined my objectives and set up some house rules for this round.

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited to do this challenge! Outlining what exactly I need to do vs what I want to do for this round was a surprisingly big effort, especially with writing detiled explanations for my objectives and house rules. Documenting stuff like this is one of the skills I'm hoping to improve by doing this challenge, so let's see how much I can do for these next 100 days!

**Link to work:** You're reading it right now, silly!

### Day 1: Tuesday, May 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Set up the conda environment for the ZTM Machine Learning course, and started the Pandas Data Analysis section.

**Thoughts:** I think there's still a few small kinks to work out so that I can properly integrate different conda environments for different courses/projects into my VSCode workflows, but so far the one I created for the ML course has been working pretty well with minimal setup. I really love how I can put my notes and code together in one place using Jupyter Notebooks, and I certainly love being able to jump right in to working with Jupyter notebooks directly in VSCode!

### Day 2: Thursday, May 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed and added notes for the the Singly Linked List section in the JS Data Structures course.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE/PEP TALK:** I Intentionally skipped a day and immediately broke my streak to hopefully remind future me that at the end of the day, it's the skills that we learn thoughout these courses that matters, and not how many days straight we can make progress. To anyone reading this: If you're starting to feel tired or burnt out, feel free to take a day or two off and just relax, and come back to the code/lessons hopefully with renewed excitement to learn, improve your skills, and git gud!

Now going back to my thoughts on this day's progress:

**Thoughts:** Again, I believe that being able to write good documentation is one of the most valuable skills a developer should have, and I'm practicing that skill by writing notes as detailed as I can and providing some helpful comments in my code while I go along this Data Structures and Algorithms course. It's definitely a skill that I believe I can only get better at through sheer amounts of practice, so here's to a lot more notes like these being written as I progress through the course!

### Day 3: Friday, May 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Revisited the new WebDev Bootcamp update and went though the Node and Express basics section.

**Thoughts:** Node + Express feels like something I've been neglecting for quite a while now so it's nice to revisit these updated sections to refresh my knowledge and better prepare for the updated YelpCamp project. I feel this is gonna be great, especially because I plan on adding my own personal twist once I (re-)do the YelpCamp project!

### Day 4: Saturday, May 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Express+EJS Templating and RESTful Routing sections from the WebDev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Pretty big progress for this day! I'm definitely getting the hang of using Express JS and RESTful routing again. Just a couple more sections left and I can really (re-)start the new YelpCamp project!

### Day 5: Sunday, May 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the MongoDB and Mongoose sections from the WebDev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Another day of big progress! I've now caught up with (most of) what I need to know to get started with the YelpCamp project. I'm really excited to go through the revamped YelpCamp project sections next week!

**Link to work:** [WDBC Revamp Backend repo](https://github.com/Insidiae/wdbc-backend-2)

### Day 6: Monday, May 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Pandas section lectures in the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** Don't let the 1hr38min video lengths for the Pandas section fool you, this course is super jam-packed with useful information and I noticed it took me more than 3-4hrs total simply coding along (without even adding the notes in) with the videos sped up to 1.5x ðŸ”¥

Even though I only planned to simply sit back and code along with the lectures today, my progress was actually a bit bigger than I planned! I'm excited to go through the exercises tomorrow!

**Link to work:** [Intro to pandas notebook (TODO: Add notes)](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-machine-learning/blob/main/1_pandas_data_analysis/introduction_to_pandas.ipynb)

### Day 7: Tuesday, May 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added my notes and completed the exercices on the Pandas section of the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** My note-taking skills still leave a lot to be desired, and I hope to keep improving it as I code along with these lectures. The exercises themselves were a breeze to go through mostly thanks to me coding along with the lecture videos. However, one minor hiccup I encountered today was that my Jupyter kernel was apparently using the wrong environment and thus wasn't able to detect and import `pandas` properly. Note to self: Always double-check my Python environments before getting started to code!

### Day 8: Wednesday, May 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Doubly Linked Lists section of the Data Structures and Algorithms course.

**Thoughts:** Refactoring my code for the Singly Linked Lists and adding the `prev` pointers needed to implement Doubly Linked Lists seemed pretty complex at first, but I realized the beauty of working with Doubly Linked Lists is that the implementations for some methods became symmetrical to other methods, meaning the methods that deal with traversing the list forwards (i.e. `push()` and `pop()`) had essentially the same code as the methods that deal with traversing the list backwards (i.e. `unshift()` and `shift`). Pretty neat stuff!

**Link to work:** [Doubly Linked List notes](https://github.com/Insidiae/js-algos-and-data-structs/blob/main/Linked%20Lists/2.%20Doubly%20Linked%20List.md)

### Day 9: Thursday, May 13th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Stacks and Queues section of the Data Structures and Algorithms course.

**Thoughts:** Again, implementing Stacks and Queues was made a lot simpler by having the codes for the Linked Lists already implemented. Catching up with the Udemy exercises was tricky though especially with the rather untested "Wild West" section, but having most of the code already written and ready to copy paste into the solution makes things a lot easier.

**Link to work:** [Stacks and Queues (TODO: Add notes)](https://github.com/Insidiae/js-algos-and-data-structs/tree/main/Stacks%20and%20Queues)

### Day 10: Friday, May 14th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the YelpCamp MERN Project! Researched the basic how-tos, did the initial setup, and added some basic routes.

**Thoughts:** Not gonna lie, redoing the YelpCamp project using MERN stack and deviating a significant bit from the course lectures felt absolutely daunting at first, but with enough research on how to do the basic setup and the standard structure for MERN projects, once the initial setup is done and I implemented the first few routes, it felt really satisfying to get the pieces start falling into place and see everything working for the first time!

**Link to work:** [YelpCamp MERN repo](https://github.com/Insidiae/yelpcamp-mern)

### Day 11: Saturday, May 15th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the CRUD functionalities for the YelpCamp campgrounds.

**Thoughts:** There's definitely still some growing pains in learning how to communicate between my React frontend and the Node+Express backend, but so far I'm really digging how Axios streamlines sending the relevant HTTP requests for my CRUD functions!

**Link to work:** [YelpCamp MERN repo](https://github.com/Insidiae/yelpcamp-mern)

### Day 12: Sunday, May 16th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: MERN project prep part 4 - researched libraries to use on the YelpCamp project. Also did the Express Middlewares section on the WebDev Bootcamp in the meantime.

**Thoughts:** I'm planning to use TailwindCSS instead of Bootstrap for the revamped YelpCamp project, but I think there's still a bit of a learning curve I need to settle before I can fully use it on the project. My main concerns for now is how to implement some of the good ol' Bootstrap components like popups, alerts/toasts, and modals (mostly on the JS side of implementing those). Looking forward to exploring more on these stuff for next week!

**Link to work:** [WDBC Revamp Backend repo](https://github.com/Insidiae/wdbc-backend-2)

### Day 13: Monday, May 17th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the NumPy section on the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** What a surprisingly massive section! As I've said before, the ZTM Machine Learning course is really concentrated with super useful information that it takes me more than twice the time just coding along with the course lectures (without even adding in my notes nor doing the end-of-section exercises), and masive props to the instructor for making the lectures interesting all the way through and really engaging to code along with!

**Link to work:** [Intro to NumPy notebook (TODO: Add notes)](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-machine-learning/blob/main/2_numpy/introduction_to_numpy.ipynb)

### Day 14: Tuesday, May 18th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the NumPy exercises on the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** Numpy was a lot smoother (or should i say straightforward?) to work with than Pandas. Each question in the exercise had this really smooth transition to the next couple questions where the answer to the first one will be used in the next questions and so on. Really super fun to work with too!

**Link to work:** [NumPy exercise notebook](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-machine-learning/blob/main/2_numpy/numpy_exercises.ipynb)

### Day 15: Friday, May 21st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Tried out Tailwind CSS as part of my YelpCamp MERN project.

**Thoughts:** Had to take a couple days off to try and fix my sleep schedule. Might have to take a couple more days before I fully get used to doing my projects earlier than usual so I can also sleep earlier!

As for the YelpCamp MERN project, I've decided to branch out a little bit more from the lectures and use Tailwind CSS instead of Bootstrap for the project. It still has that bit of a learing curve where I might have to re-implement some of the usual Bootstrap components like navbars/buttons/forms/etc. from scratch, but with the various free resources available online I think I can manage just that!

**Link to work:** [YelpCamp MERN repo](https://github.com/Insidiae/yelpcamp-mern)

### Day 16: Saturday, May 22nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Styled the basic routes of the YelpCamp MERN project using Tailwind CSS.

**Thoughts:** Thanks to the various components from TailwindComponents and the free components from the official Tailwind UI docs, I've styled the YelpCamp project to look decent using the card, button, icon, and form components I copied and tweaked from those resources. Looking good so far, though I definitely will have to address the issue of possibly DRY-ing up some of the commonly-used styles later. For that, I will have to research more about some best practices on reusing Tailwind components!

Oh, by the way: I've also gotten a 100-day streak on Duolingo for my Japanese language learning side-project!

![Duolingo 100 day streak!!!](img/duo100.png)

I still have a lot of sections left to finish up on Duolingo, so here's to several more days on that streak!

### Day 17: Sunday, May 23rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added notes to my Data Structures and Algorithms and ZTM Machine Learning course notebooks.

**Thoughts:** Pretty chill day, though it helps to tie up some loose ends from these past days and add notes to my course notebooks. This also lets me review the topics covered in the course lectures and reinforce my knowledge in those topics, as well as sharpening my note-taking and documentation skills.

### Day 18: Monday, May 24th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the Matplotlib section in ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** I'm definitely seeing how the Matplotlib workflow is similar to MATLAB, and I'm quite liking how well the workflows of Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib blend so well together. Tomorrow's going to be a big day finishing the rest of the Matplotlib section and exercises. I also hope I can add in the rest of my course notes tomorrow!

**Link to work:** [Intro to Matplotlib notebook (TODO: Finish section and add notes)](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-machine-learning/blob/main/3_matplotlib_plotting_and_data_visualization/introduction_to_matplotlib.ipynb)

### Day 19: Saturday, May 30th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Error handling section on the Web Development Bootcamp, and added error handling and data validation logic on the YelpCamp MERN project.

**Thoughts:** I finally went full circle from starting to learn Async/Await from [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YkUCxvaLEk), with the Express Error Handling section finally solving the last missing piece of using Async/Await with Higher-Order Functions to pass the errors to the error handling middlewares.

Going back to the YelpCamp MERN project, I still need to figure out how to manage error handling between the React frontend and the Express backend, and figure out which parts actually need the data validation logic.

### Day 20: Wednesday, June 16th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Binary Search Trees section of the Data Structures and Algorithms course.

**Thoughts:** Starting to get my mojo back, so I proceeded through the Data Structures and Algorithms course and made a lot of progress on Binary Search Trees. Using recursion to traverse the BST streamlined a lot of the code and makes it easier to understand how the BFS/DFS tracersal works. I still have a bit of trouble wrapping my head around how to remove nodes as there still seems to be a lot of edge cases to consider, and my current implementation still seems a bit hacky.

**Link to work:** [Binary Search Tree Code (TODO: Add notes)](https://github.com/Insidiae/js-algos-and-data-structs/blob/main/Binary%20Search%20Trees/src/binarySearchTree.js)

### Day 21: Monday, July 19th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Matplotlib section lectures in ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** The Matplotlib section really was a lot of information to take in, and it definitely took me quite a lot of time to really nail the concepts and the general workflow, but I'd say all that effort and the time I took to really understand the concepts paid off at the end! I've been able to create beautiful data visualizations using Matplotlib, customizing them even further with the various styles and color schemes offered by Matplotlib, and export the graphs into easily shareable image files. Looking forward into the next section!

**Link to work:** [Intro to Matplotlib notebook (TODO: add more notes)](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-machine-learning/blob/main/3_matplotlib_plotting_and_data_visualization/introduction_to_matplotlib.ipynb)

### Day 22: Tuesday, July 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Matplotlib section exercises in the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** Doing the Matplotlib section exercises was a really nice way of reinforcing what I learned from this section of the course. I'm getting the hang of the general Matplotlib workflow, and I get to have another reference to look back on in case I forget some stuff ðŸ‘Œ

### Day 23: Wednesday, July 21st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished various exercises regarding Frequency Counters and Divide and Conquer/Binary Search.

**Thoughts:** Had to do a bit of research on various applications of Binary Search to solve some exercises, and [MyCodeSchool's lectures on Binary Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoUiNv1SZA) gave me all the information I needed!

I'd actually like to dedicate this day to MyCodeSchool's founders, [read more about their story here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/mycodeschool-youtube-channel-history/). Huge kudos to MyCodeSchool for providing easy-to-understand tutorials on various programming topics, and many thanks for sharing your knowlegde to programmers around the world!

### Day 24: Thursday, July 22nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Binary Heaps section of the Data Structures and Algorithms course.

**Thoughts:** Binary Heaps were really fun to implement, especially since a big chunk of the process can be simplified by simply storing the values in an array and just doing a bit of math on the indices to get parent/children nodes. The concepts behind Binary Heaps can also be applied into some other cool stuff as well, such as Priority Queues. As a bonus exercise, I also implemented Heapsort using the concepts I learned from this section.

**Link to work:** [Binary Heaps](https://github.com/Insidiae/js-algos-and-data-structs/tree/main/Binary%20Heaps)

### Day 25: Thursday, August 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Hash Tables and Graphs sections of the Data Structures and Algorithms course.

**Thoughts:** I remember Hash Tables being quite the difficult topic back when I was at university learning Data Structures using C++, but now I had a much, **_MUCH_** easier time understanding the concepts this time around using JavaScript, partly because Hash Tables already exist here in the form of objects or maps.

As for graphs, they really did seem to be such a daunting topic at first, but after going through the lecture videos I now see how simple implementing graphs can be, at least for the basic graph structures. I'm really looking forward to tackling Graph Traversals, and I'm really excited to research the various awesome applications of these Graph data structures!

This is now also the final stretch of the Data Structures and Algorithms course. Just a few sections left, and we're going to get the very first course completion on this round!

**Link to work:** [Hash Tables](https://github.com/Insidiae/js-algos-and-data-structs/tree/main/Hash%20Tables), [Graphs](https://github.com/Insidiae/js-algos-and-data-structs/tree/main/Graphs)

### Day 26: Friday, August 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Graph traversal and Dijkstra's Algorithm sections of the Data Structures and Algorithms course.

**Thoughts:** As with yesterday, Graph Traversal seemed to be a really daunting section at first, but as I went through the section I realized how intuitive it is to code, especially as I notice the similarities from the Tree Traversal section I did earlier. The Dijkstra's Algorithm section was a really fun trip down memory lane as my previous Cisco classes from university already introduced me to the topic (albeit only through pen-and-paper diagrams), but it was really nice finally being able to code it up in JavaScript and seeing the results!

Oh by the way, I've now also completed the Japanese Language section from Duolingo! After a 176 day streak of doing Duolingo lessons daily, I've now finally completed all the lessons on the Japanese skill tree. Cheers to that, and I am super looking forward to clearing the other courses I'm doing in this round as well!

**Link to work:** [Graphs](https://github.com/Insidiae/js-algos-and-data-structs/tree/main/Graphs)

### Day 27: Saturday, August 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Tries section of the Data Structures and Algorithms course, and started adding notes to the previous sections.

**Thoughts:** Colt Steele's Data Structures and Algorithms course doesn't have a lecture section on Tries, but instead has a few extra coding challenges regarding Tries. I referenced the ZTM FAANG interviews course to get a basic overview on how to implement Tries, and I then tweaked it a bit to fit the context of the coding exercises in Colt Steele's course. It was a pretty fun extra challenge that applies what I learned in the previous sections about Binary Trees and Graphs, as the process of traversing Tries is substantially similar to how to traverse other kinds of Trees and Graphs.

Before I get working on the last section of the Data Structures and Algorithms course, I want to first go back to the previous sections and start adding my notes as a way of documenting my code and overall just make it easier to reference the topics as needed.

**Link to work:** [Tries](https://github.com/Insidiae/js-algos-and-data-structs/tree/main/Tries), [BST section notes](https://github.com/Insidiae/js-algos-and-data-structs/blob/main/Binary%20Search%20Trees/1.%20Binary%20Search%20Trees.md)

### Day 28: Sunday, August 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished adding notes to the previous sections of the Data Structures and Algorithms course.

**Thoughts:** Aaannd we're finally caught up with my notes on all the sections I've done so far! Adding the notes on the completed sections was a really nice way of revisiting the topics, solidify the concepts I learned, and document the code I've written. It also makes my progress a lot more referenceable, and I plan to keep on improving and adding on my notes as I research more topics on Data Structures and Algorithms beyond the scope of the Udemy courses I took.

Only one section left to complete the course. Let's go!!!!!!!

**Link to work:** [Binary Heaps section notes](https://github.com/Insidiae/js-algos-and-data-structs/tree/main/Binary%20Heaps), [Hash Tables section notes](https://github.com/Insidiae/js-algos-and-data-structs/blob/main/Hash%20Tables/1.%20Hash%20Tables.md), [Graphs section notes](https://github.com/Insidiae/js-algos-and-data-structs/tree/main/Graphs), [Tries section notes](https://github.com/Insidiae/js-algos-and-data-structs/blob/main/Tries/1.%20Tries.md)

### Day 29: Tuesday, August 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Dynamic Procramming section of the Data Structures and Algorithms course, **and earned the course completion certificate**.

**Thoughts:** I have now gotten the very first course certificate earned after starting this challenge! Kudos to the amazing instructors Colt Steele for the amazing coding exercises that really helped me gauge my progress along the course, and Andrei Neagoie and the ZTM community for the well-structured course lectures that supplemented my progress throughout the course.

With the Data Structures and Algorithms course finally completed (as far as the course completion requirements are concerned, that is), I now have a complete code repository documenting every topic I came across throughout the course, complete with several Markdown files containing some basic notes and explanations about the topics as well as the code solutions I wrote to pass the coding challenges. I also have a basic website deployed using Github Pages that provide the working examples with some test cases that can be copy-pasted into the console to view the results.

In the future, I also plan to combine my Markdown notes with the Github Pages website and create an easy-to-navigate sort of online book to easily reference various topics on Data Structures and Algorithms with the explanations and code examples/test cases on the same page!

That's it for me today. Onwards to further learning on Data Structures and Algorithms with the ZTM FAANG Interview course, up next!

### Day 30: Monday, August 30th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the Scikit-Learn section of the ZTM Machine Learning course, exploring the typical workflow of a Scikit-Learn project.

**Thoughts:** Hoo boy, this section is a big one! I plan to take this section at a reasonable pace, which means having to somehow split this 7hr+ section into separate chunks. The starter lecture videos were a great introduction to the typical Scikit-Learn workflow, and it's really exciting to dive deeper into the finer concepts of Scikit-Learn. Pretty great stuff!

Oh, by the way, while I was gone I also participated in ReactJS Philippines' Minify Coding Competition! It was great getting to serve as sort of a final exam for the DSA course I just completed, and I'm pretty proud of my score in that event!

### Day 31: Wednesday, September 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the first three sections of the ZTM FAANG course.

**Thoughts:** It's now time to take my problem solving skills to the next level by doing more advanced programming problems with the ZTM FAANG Interview course! The first three sections about array problems were a great intro to what the course offers, providing some challenging array problems with a detailed walthrough on the thought process on what goes into the brute-force and optimal solutions.

As I keep going through the ZTM FAANG course, I hope that I can deepen my knowledge on the topics previously covered in the Data Structures and Algorithms course, and maybe pick up some nifty problem solving tricks to add to my arsenal!

### Day 32: Thursday, September 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the fourth section of the ZTM FAANG course.

**Thoughts:** The brute-force solution to the problem was relatively easy, though figuring out the optimal solution was a bit tricky. Using the hints given by the instructor, I tried working though the optimal solution by myself, but even though I thought I got the thought process correct, my solution was failing on some test cases at first. Then it turns out that I used an `&&` operator where there should've been an `||` operator instead. Whoops :p

### Day 33: Saturday, September 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Hacktoberfest prep 1 - Started a Git and Github course, learning the basics of commits, branches, and merging.

**Thoughts:** It's been a long time overdue now, but I think it's time to start getting serious about Git and Github workflows, especially if I'm going to be seriously participating in Hacktoberfest next month. I know about the basic commit-and-push workflow, but I feel that I need to learn how to work with multiple branches, resolve conflicting changes, and much more advanced workflows using Git, even moreso when I start doing larger projects.

**Link to work:** ~~TVA~~ TBA

### Day 34: Monday, September 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the first part of the Scikit-Learn section of the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** The ZTM Machine Learning course continues its trend of containing such a large amount of information in just a few video lectures. For the first part (out of a 7-step process) of the Scikit-Learn section, we take a look at the process of preparing a dataset before fitting a machine learning model. We discuss how to split a dataset into training and test sets, convert non-numeric features of the dataset into a numeric form, and handle missing data by filling in or removing rows with missing values, as well as some guidelines and best practices when working with such datasets.

### Day 35: Tuesday, September 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the second part of the Scikit-Learn section of the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** 2/7 steps done! Again, the ZTM Machine Learning course continues to be jam-packed with super useful information densely packed into the course lecture videos. Today I also got back into the groove on writing the notes alsongside my code thanks to the overhauled notebook interface by VS Code. It now feels much easier than ever to write beautiful Jupyter notebooks, powered by the usual VS Code extensions we know and love!

### Day 36: Wednesday, September 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 5th and 6th sections of the ZTM FAANG course.

**Thoughts:** Making solid progress through the ZTM FAANG course. These next two problems were somewhat a rehash of some problems I've already done before on the Data Structures and Algorihms course, but it's nice to get another look at my previous codes and find a more optimal approach this time around.

### Day 37: Friday, September 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the React+Redux section of the ZTM JTS course.

**Thoughts:** I just went ahead and satisfied my curiosity about Redux today by finishing the React+Redux section of the ZTM JTS course. I also went ahead and implemented the sample Robofirends app using React Hooks and Redux instead of the Class-based components seen in the lecture videos. It took a bit of reading through the documentation to figure out how to use the Hooks API for React-Redux, but it ended up being quite smoother to implement. Definitely excited to dive deeper with Redux in a later project!

### Day 38: Saturday, September 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Performance Part 1 and Part 2 sections of the ZTM JTS course.

**Thoughts:** Decided to make some more progress on the ZTM JTS course today because why not :^)

Picked up some new neat tricks about improving the performance of web applications, especially some really useful React tools like Code Splitting, `React.memo`, and PWAs using `create-react-app`. It's also really nice to see that PWA support is provided out of the box with `create-react-app`, and with just a couple minor adjustments we can have a perfect 100/100 score on Google Lighthouse tests!

### Day 39: Sunday, September 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Hacktoberfest prep 2 - Massive progress in The Git and Github Bootcamp (Diff, Stash, Revert, Fetch, Pull).

**Thoughts:** I made some great progress in The Git and Github Bootcamp today! I've just finished the basics of working with Git and Github, and learned several new Git commands for vrious different purposes. I especially enjoyed the Time Travelling section where we take a look at previous commits, moving changes into a new branch, and restoring/reverting commits. Looking forward to next week where we explore deeper into collaboration workflows using Git and Github!

### Day 40: Thursday, September 16th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 7th to 9th sections of the ZTM FAANG course.

**Thoughts:** Today's progress is all about Linked List traversal questions. The questions presented in the ZTM FAANG course did seem quite daunting at first, but watching the logical approach videos relly put me in the perfect place to solve the problems after I diagrammed the approach and planned out how the code is supposed to work. Even that one question about the multi-level linked list became a lot smoother to approach once I figured out how the traversal algorithm works!

### Day 41: Friday, September 17th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Hacktoberfest prep 3 - Finished The Git & Github Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** Another course completed! That wraps up my prep for the upcoming Hacktoberfest by finishing off the Git and Github Bootcamp and taking a look at collaboration workflows, some advanced/niche Git stuff like reflogs and custom aliases, and taking a look at how Git works behind the scenes. I should now have the basic Git skills necessary to start contributing for Hacktoberfest projects!

On a side note: that section on how Git works made me appreciate Git more, as well as the underlying topics Git was built upon like Cryptographic Hashing, key-value stores, trees and pointers, etc. I not have a much deeper respect for all the developers that made Git possible by applying such advanced computer science topics and made this powerful tool used by developers around the world!

### Day 42: Sunday, September 19th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Mongo and Express Data Relationships sections in The Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Been a while since my last progress in The WDBC revamp! For now I've just taken the time te review my code in the previous sections as well as reorient myself on the next steps in my MERN remake of the YelpCamp course project. Next up, I'll be applying what I learned in the Mongo Data Relationship sections and add some more functionalities in the YelpCamp MERN project!

### Day 43: Wednesday, September 22nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 10th to 12th sections of the ZTM FAANG course.

**Thoughts:** Back to the classic Stacks and Queues problems today! I gained some valuable insight as to how Stacks can be applied in certain problems involving matching parentheses (because that one used to stump me back in university), and it's refreshing to see how well I can keep up with the lecture videos now, and even getting the Leetcode question already correct before I even finish the logic explanation lecture!

### Day 44: Thursday, September 23rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 13th and 14th sections of the ZTM FAANG course.

**Thoughts:** Again, the FAANG questions for today's topic revisit some of the concepts already covered in the Data Structures and Algorithms course. The code snippets I already had for Quicksort and Binary Search were extremely useful for quickly solving today's FAANG questions, plus going through the lecture videos gave additional insight and optimize and/or clean up my previous solutions!

### Day 45: Monday, September 27th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the third part of the Scikit-Learn section of the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** Pretty light day today, but it's still more progress on the ZTM ML course. Just a couple more parts left in the Scikit-Learn section and we can finally move on to doing the big projects!

**Link to work:** [Intro to Scikit-Learn notebook](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-machine-learning/blob/main/4_scikit-learn_creating_machine_learning_models/introduction_to_scikit-learn.ipynb)

### Day 46: Wednesday, September 29th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 15th to 19th sections of the ZTM FAANG course.

**Thoughts:** Masive progress in the ZTM FAANG course! Today's progress is all about FAANG questions regarding Binary Trees. It's quite refreshing to see how my previous codes about traversing Binary Trees helping a lot by providing a solid starting point where the solutions are based off on. By slightly tweaking some bits on my BFS/DFS traversal code, I was easily able to get the solutions up and running!

### Day 47: Wednesday, October 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 20th to 22nd sections of the ZTM FAANG course.

**Thoughts:** Another massive progress in the ZTM FAANG course! I've also added a new topic about 2-dimensional arrays to my DSA repo thanks to today's topic. Following along the solutions on traversing 2D arrays via DFS and BFS was the key to solving today's FAANG questions. Once I figured out the general process on traversing 2D arrays, it's really just a matter of using the right traversal method and tweaking it to suit the problem's needs ðŸ”¥

### Day 48: Thursday, October 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 23rd to 25th sections of the ZTM FAANG course.

**Thoughts:** Today's topic is all about Graphs. Again, my previous experience with graphs on the DSA course proved to be essential in quickly solving these Graph-related FAANG questions. Plus, it does feel a bit refreshing to just code the graph directly for the FAANG questions without having to define a new class by just using the adjacency list and working from there.

Only 5 more FAANG questions remain. Let's do our best in this home stretch and earn another course completion certificate!

### Day 49: Friday, October 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 26th and 27th sections of the ZTM FAANG course.

**Thoughts:** Today I added another topic for the Graphs section of my DSA notes, thanks to the ZTM FAANG course introducing me to the Bellman-Ford algorithm. With that new algorithm added to my arsenal I can now handle negative weights and not get stuck in an infinite loop when there is a negative cycle on the input weighted graph!

I also worked on the Dynamic Programming questions on the ZTM FAANG course. It honestly shocked me how well I was able to keep up with the lecture videos explaining the topic, and even being able to code out the solution before the instructor finishes explaining the solution approach!

### Day 50: Saturday, October 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 28th to 30th sections of the ZTM FAANG course, **and earned the course completion certificate**.

**Thoughts:** We've now reached the halfway point in this round, and I'm quite proud to say that I have a lot of progress to show for it!

Today I earned another course completion certificate by completing the ZTM FAANG course. Kudos to the instructors for taking my skills to another level! Cheers to this proof of my solid progress in this round, and here's to making steady progress on the rest of this round's courses!

### Day 51: Monday, October 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued through the Scikit-Learn section of the ZTM Machine Learning course, and updated my project notebook from Scikit-Learn v0.22 to v1.0.

**Thoughts:** We're now in the second half of this round, which means I can take some time to refocus on some projects that I feel are lagging behind. I've done quite a lot of progress in the ZTM Machine Learning course today, and I plan to continue on with this solid progress and work my way into fuly completing this course!

I've also noticed that Scikit-Learn released a major update, and so I've updated my project notebook to get the latest and greatest Scikit-Learn has to offer! A fair bit of testing to see if everything works and tweaking some minor hiccups along the way, and I now have access to the latest features of Scikit-Learn!

**Link to work:** [Intro to Scikit-Learn notebook](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-machine-learning/blob/main/4_scikit-learn_creating_machine_learning_models/introduction_to_scikit-learn.ipynb)

### Day 52: Saturday, October 16th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Scikit-Learn section lectures of the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** What a massive section! Seriously, the Scikit-Learn section of the ZTM Machine Learning course can be a standalone course all by itself, covering such a wide range of topics and workflows around Scikit-Learn.

With this section finally completed, I can finally move on to doing the course projects and take the skills I've learned so far up to the test! Looking forward to doing the projects!

### Day 53: Sunday, October 17th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Testing section of the ZTM JTS course.

**Thoughts:** Overall a pretty straightforward section. I spiced things up a bit by diverting from the lectures and used React Testing Library to test my React app instead of Enzyme, but the process is still pretty much the same.

**Link to work:** [Testing section solution repo](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-robofriends-testing)

### Day 54: Monday, October 18th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Scikit-Learn section exercises of the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** And now the time I spent carefully going through the Scikit-Learn section lectures has finally paid off! The exercise ended up a breeze to go through, even moreso with the extremely helpful documentation outlining the steps I needed to go through. Plus, with the new knowledge I gained from upgrading my Scikit-Learn to the latest version, I also used the new and improved methods provided by Scikit-Learn v1.0 and really streamlined some parts of the code, particularly in plotting the ROC curve and Confusion Matrix graphs.

Onwards to the milestone projects, coming up next!

### Day 55: Tuesday, October 19th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Milestone Project 1 of the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** Massive progress in the ZTM Machine Learning course! With this first milestone project, we used the usual heart disease dataset and built a solid workflow for creating machine learning models for the dataset. It's pretty much the similar workflow as with the Scikit-Learn section's, but we take things a step further training and evaluating multiple types of machine learning models.

**Link to work:** [Milestone Project 1 notebook](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-machine-learning/blob/main/5_milestone_project_classification/heart_disease_classification.ipynb)

### Day 56: Wednesday, October 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Typescript section of the ZTM JTS course.

**Thoughts:** This section was a pretty simple but solid introduction to Typescript. It was pretty great to see how surprisingly smooth it was to convert an existing React Hooks app into Typescript using VSCode. The type hints pretty much carried me all the way to fully converting the Robofriends app!

**Link to work:** [Robofriends with Hooks feat. Typescript](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-robofriends-hooks-typescript)

### Day 57: Thursday, October 21st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the SSR and Security sections of the ZTM JTS course.

**Thoughts:** Great progress in the ZTM JTS course! It was pretty nice to revisit Next.js and see its latest features, and convert the Robofriends app into Next.js.

The Security section was also a good introductory primer into the different vulnerabilities that arise when building web apps, and also some basic countermeasures and best practices to minimize the risk of falling into these vulnerabilities.

**Link to work:** [Robofriends with Hooks feat. Next.js](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-next-ssr)

### Day 58: Friday, October 22nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Milestone Project 2 of the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** We're into the homestretch in the ZTM Machine Learning course! This second Milestone Project was a very comprehensive exercise that tests pretty much everything discussed so far in the course.

I'm super excited to do the final project of the course and finally get started with Deep Learning using Tensorflow!

**Link to work:** [Milestone Project 2 notebook](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-machine-learning/blob/main/6_milestone_project_time_series_data/bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb)

### Day 59: Saturday, October 23rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the Tensorflow section of the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** Today's my first deep dive into using Google Colaboratory and Tensorflow thanks to the ZTM Machine Learning course! Today's progress is all about doing the first half of the section and getting everything set up so that I can get right into building models tomorrow. For now, the general workflow for preprocessing the data feels right at home with what I've learned so far. Very excited to work on building the actual tensorflow models tomorrow!

**Link to work:** [Tensorflow section notebook](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-machine-learning/blob/main/7_deep_learning_neural_networks_tensorflow_2/dog_vision.ipynb)

### Day 60: Sunday, October 24th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Tensorflow section of the ZTM Machine Learning course, **and earned the course completion certificate**.

**Thoughts:** Woohoo!!! Another course completion in the bag.

Massive thanks to the instructors for such a comprehensive course on Machine Learning. The course lectures clock in at 43 total hours, but I've easily taken more than 2 or 3 times that time following along and doing the exercises because of how jam-packed with useful information this course is.

Looking forward to taking on the Tensorflow course up next!

**Link to work:** [Tensorflow section notebook](https://github.com/Insidiae/ztm-machine-learning/blob/main/7_deep_learning_neural_networks_tensorflow_2/dog_vision.ipynb)

### Day 61: Sunday, October 31st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Code Analysis section of the ZTM JTS course.

**Thoughts:** Onto the final project in the ZTM JTS course! The Code Analysis section introduces the Smart Brain project from ZTM's Web Dev course, and my task was to dive right in to the project, examine all the progress made so far, and add a new feature into the app.

Going through the section I noticed that my method to add the new feature into the app was the inverse of how the intstructor did it in the solution video - Where the instructor prefers to scan through everything first and get a general idea of how the app works then works all the way down to the component/s where the new feature is to be added, I kinda did things in reverse and examined the component I needed to change, work my way upwards and examine the other components that affect/are affected by that component. The end result was exactly the same, but the contrast between the instructor's top-down approach vs my bottom-up approach felt quite interesting...

### Day 62: Monday, November 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Error Handling, Modules, and HTTP Requests sections of the Modern Python 3 Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Now that I think about it, now's a pretty good time to dive deeper into Python and complete the Python 3 course. That said, I'm starting to get fairly comfortable using Python! With the help of gaining some extra bit of experience from doing the ZTM Machine Learning course and doing some other projects and exercises using Python, I'm starting to get more confident writing better Python code.

**Link to work:** [Python Levelgrind](https://github.com/Insidiae/python-levelgrind/tree/master/intermediate)

### Day 63: Tuesday, November 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the OOP Part 1 section and the Deck of Cards Project of the Modern Python 3 Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Today's a pretty big day! I decided completely on a whim to check out freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python projects to see which topics I need to review, and I went and completed all five certification projects in one go! Yep, I'm definitely feeling more and more confident writing Python code now ðŸ”¥

Oh, yeah, and I also progressed through the OOP section on the Modern Python 3 Bootcamp. I've already encountered the OOP topics while I was doing the freeCodeCamp projects, so going through today's sections was a breeze.

### Day 64: Wednesday, November 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the YelpCamp Reviews section of The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021.

**Thoughts:** Been a while since I worked on my MERN remake of the YelpCamp project, and admittedly at first taking on this MERN remake project feels quite daunting, but as I follow along with the course lectures and reading the docs on the things the course doesn't cover for my MERN remake, I can easily compare the differences and implement the same features in my project. Onwards to the next sections!

**Link to work:** [YelpCamp MERN](https://github.com/Insidiae/yelpcamp-mern)

### Day 65: Thursday, November 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Express Router & Cookies and Express Session & Flash sections of The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021.

**Thoughts:** The two sections went by pretty fast, but they do cover quite a bunch of important topics.Moving over back into the YelpCamp MERN project, the Express Router/Cookies/Session topics can translate over pretty much the same way, but I'm mostly wondering how I'll be implementing flash messages in the React frontend...

**Link to work:** [Web Dev Bootcamp Backend repo](https://github.com/Insidiae/wdbc-backend-2)

### Day 66: Friday, November 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the YelpCamp Restructuring & Flash section of The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021.

**Thoughts:** React-Router really helped make implementing flash messeges a breeze! Reading up a bit on the react-router docs, turns out I can just pass along the flash message via location state and now all I had to do was make some fancy dismissable alert boxes via Tailwind to display my new flash messages.

**Link to work:** [YelpCamp MERN](https://github.com/Insidiae/yelpcamp-mern)

### Day 67: Sunday, November 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the YelpCamp Authentication and Authorization sections of The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021.

**Thoughts:** Massive progress today! And for good reason too. I'm pretty much in the homestretch of The Web Developer Bootcamp after finishing these two massive sections and implementing them in my YelpCamp MERN remake. Adding in these Authentication and Authorization feetures was indeed no small feat, and it did take me quite a while to wrap my head around it especially when trying to interface my React frontend with the Express backend. On the flip side, that's pretty much all the heavy features of the YelpCamp project done. All that's left is to add in some bonus features such as image upload and map views, and we're good to deploy and finish course for the second time around!

**Link to work:** [YelpCamp MERN](https://github.com/Insidiae/yelpcamp-mern)

### Day 68: Tuesday, November 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the OOP Part 2 section of the Modern Python 3 Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Alright, I think I've caught up to the basic and intermediate stuff about Python now. Just a couple topics left to review, then I can proceed to doing some more Python projects and finish the course!

**Link to work:** [Python Levelgrind](https://github.com/Insidiae/python-levelgrind/tree/master/intermediate)

### Day 69 (nice): Wednesday, November 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the YelpCamp Image Upload section of The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021.

**Thoughts:** This one was admittedly quite tricky to implement, as I have to juggle my data and API requests between my React frontend and Express backend. There's definitely a lot of room for improvement and refactoring, but hey, this one works fine for now so I'll take it.

**Link to work:** [YelpCamp MERN](https://github.com/Insidiae/yelpcamp-mern)

### Day 70: Thursday, November 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the YelpCamp Maps and Style Cleanup sections of The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021.

**Thoughts:** The YelpCamp MERN Remake is now functionally done! All that is left for the project is some bonus security features and deployment and I can wrap up the project and get the course certificate for The Web Developer Bootcamp (again). This project covered quite a lot, and quite a few features ended up being quite daunting to implement, but we did it! Cheers!

**Link to work:** [YelpCamp MERN](https://github.com/Insidiae/yelpcamp-mern)

### Day 71: Friday, November 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the YelpCamp project of The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021, **and re-earned the course completion certificate**.

**Thoughts:** That's it for the YelpCamp MERN Remake project, and by extension my second round at The Web Developer Bootcamp! This has been a truly comprehensive course, even moreso with all the revamped videos. Going through the new content was a blast the entire time, and remaking the final course project using a different tech stack was really tough for sure, but it feels so rewarding to see the completed project fully live and deployed. Onwards to the next course projects!

### Day 72: Sunday, November 14th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Intro to CSS Grid section of the Advanced CSS and Sass course, and updated the project dependencies.

**Thoughts:** That's it for the YelpCamp MERN Remake project, and by extension my second round at The Web Developer Bootcamp! This has been a truly comprehensive course, even moreso with all the revamped videos.

### Day 73: Monday, November 15th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Iterators and Generators section of the Modern Python 3 Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Pretty decent progress today. Iterators are a pretty nifty way to loop over items in Python, and I can definitely see some use cases where it makes more sense to use these. They're also made even easier using Generators to create iterators super quickly!

### Day 74: Wednesday, November 17th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic layout for the Nexter project of the Advanced CSS and Sass course.

**Thoughts:** That went a lot quicker than I expected! Seems like I've still got my CSS skills up to spec, and I can follow along with the course lectures really smoothly. Up next, I'll be adding a bit of my own custom touches to wrap things up for the Nexter project and get that course completion certificate!

### Day 75: Friday, November 19th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Nexter project of the Advanced CSS and Sass course, **and earned the course completion certificate**.

**Thoughts:** Another course completed! The Nexter project was a breeze to work with, and I really like how CSS Grid minimized the amount of media queries we had to write to make the site truly responsive. As a bonus, I also made the sidebar nav come to life by porting some of the navigation tricks from the earlier projects, and I like how the final project turned out!

### Day 76: Saturday, November 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Docker section of the ZTM JTS course.

**Thoughts:** Installed Docker for the first time today. I can definitely see the appeal in being able to setup a whole environment in just a couple config files, and not have to worry about most installation problems on different operting systems. Plus, with the next section about Redis which doesn't support Windows as far as I've heard, Docker can be a great tool to add Redis into the course project anyway!

### Day 77: Sunday, November 21st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Redis section of the ZTM JTS course.

**Thoughts:** Used the Try Redis playground for now instead of installing on my PC, since it seems like we'll be using Docker to help with that in the later section. I've gotten a sneak peek of how to store session data with the YelpCamp MERN project, let's see how Redis helps with that in the upcoming Sessions + JWT section of the ZTM JTS course!

### Day 78: Monday, November 22nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Decorators section of The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Today I got a peek at how those `@` symbol decorators work behind the scenes. I've seen them here and there among various code snippets I encounter, and it's quite amusing to know that they're really just a special kind of higher order functions behind the scenes. This topic also seems relevant not just in Python, but in JavaScript/TypeScript as well - I've definitely seen those `@` symbols in some code snippets as well!

### Day 79: Tuesday, November 23rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Testing section of The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Decent progress today. It's great to know that Python actually has a built-in testing module to help write tests for my Python code, and writing tests for a previous exercise was a breeze.

### Day 80: Wednesday, November 24th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the Sesstions + JWT section of the ZTM JTS course.

**Thoughts:** Set up the dev environment for this section for the first time using Docker. I really like how smooth and consistent the workflow is using Docker + WSL2. It just feels so natural and my workflow for developing this new SmartBrain course project stayed pretty much the same even while using Docker.

### Day 81: Thursday, November 25th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Sesstions + JWT section of the ZTM JTS course.

**Thoughts:** Again, the general workflow for the backend server was pretty smooth using Docker, aside from one small hiccup caused by the `node-redis` package being updated literally today, but it was pretty simple to fix once I figured out what's going on and used the appropriate version for the project.

Adding in the JWT + Session code for the Smart Brain project, I was able to compare it to my previos YelpCamp MERN project and how I managed user sessions using cookies. With both of these session management strategies in mind, I now have a solid reference for whatever project I'll be doing next!

### Day 82: Friday, November 26th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the AWS and Performance Part 3 sections of the ZTM JTS course.

**Thoughts:** Decided to take it easy for today and just follow along with the course lectures. These two sections about AWS and improving server-side performance do have really useful information, but I feel like it's a bit beyond the scope of what I'm trying to accomplish for now. I can definitely see myself going back to these sections when the time comes where these topics become more relevant for me, and I'm looking forward to progress enough with my career to get to that level!

### Day 83: Saturday, November 27th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the CI/CD section of the ZTM JTS course, **and earned the course completion certificate**.

**Thoughts:** Another course completion in the bag, and boy what a ride that was! The ZTM JTS course covered a truly wide range of topics, and following along with the course exercises and projects was a blast, especially with how we can see the improvements being made as we add more features demonstrating what we've learned in each section the two main projects featured in the course.

### Day 84: Sunday, November 28th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the File I/O and Working with CSV sections of The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** I've already worked with files for quite a bunch on the ZTM ML course, so this section was a breeze to go through. It was nice to see how vanilla Python works with files and even CSV datasets.

### Day 85: Monday, November 29th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup section of The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Working with BeautifulSoup to scrape data from websites was quite fun, and surprisingly intuitive thanks to my previous experience working with the web. Once I know which elements to get data from, it was just a matter of applying the appropriate selectors and get the data I need!

### Day 86: Tuesday, November 30th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Regular Expressions section of The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Regular Expressions are a really powerful tool to work with strings - not just in Python specifically, but in other languages as well. The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp only touches upon the basics of RegEx, but it's still really nice to learn about some common RegEx use cases. I can definitely see myself doing more RegEx exercises in the future!

### Day 87: Wednesday, December 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Python + SQL section of The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** SQLite was apparently so light I didn't realize I already have it installed all along! It might've been from some random package install on some previous project, but the installation part was besically instant thanks to that. I really like how easy it was to create new databases using SQLite, and how _lite_ those databases I created in the section exercises ended up being!

### Day 88: Thursday, December 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Python coding challenges section of The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp, **and earned the course completion certificate**.

**Thoughts:** Another course completion in the bag! I really like how The Modern Python 3 bootcamp takes advantage of the Udemy coding challenge platform to give lots of hands-on exercises that test the topics we've learned in the course. The last massive section of coding challenges contained a bunch of short and sweet exercises, and it was quite fun going back to the good ol' DSA topics and apply them in Python!

### Day 89: Friday, December 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the User Flows and Sitemaps section of the ZTM Web & Mobile Designer course, and binged the bonus sections.

**Thoughts:** We're so close to hitting the 100 day mark! The ZTM Web & Mobile Designer course is most likely the last course I'll be completing for this round, and I'll just save the other ones for the new round next year. It's definitely a lot more chill compared to the previous courses I've completed this round, but it's nice to learn some design fundamentals before diving deep into more advanced stuff next year ðŸ˜‰

### Day 90: Saturday, December 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Wireframes, Prototypes, and Feedback sections of the ZTM Web & Mobile Designer course.

**Thoughts:** Still have to get used to the user interface, but creating wireframes for web and mobile apps in Figma was really smooth! I can see how this workflow can be used in my next projects as an initial design step. Good stuff!

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 91: Sunday, December 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Spacing and the Grid, Typography, and Color sections of the ZTM Web & Mobile Designer course.

**Thoughts:** I still find it somewhat tough to apply these sections' concepts into a concrete example, but I occasionally think of small glimpses for how I can choose fonts and create a color scheme for my projects, with the help of the tools I'm familiar with plus some bits of CSS knowledge here and there. I figure these concepts are going to click much more when I get to a part where I can translate these Figma designs into actual websites/applications.
