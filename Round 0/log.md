# 100 Days Of Code - Round 0 Log

### Day 0: Monday, May 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did some prep work for the 100 Days of Code challenge, outlined my objectives and set up some house rules for this round.

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited to do this challenge! Outlining what exactly I need to do vs what I want to do for this round was a surprisingly big effort, especially with writing detiled explanations for my objectives and house rules. Documenting stuff like this is one of the skills I'm hoping to improve by doing this challenge, so let's see how much I can do for these next 100 days!

**Link to work:** You're reading it right now, silly!
