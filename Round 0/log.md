# 100 Days Of Code - Round 0 Log

### Day 0: Monday, May 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did some prep work for the 100 Days of Code challenge, outlined my objectives and set up some house rules for this round.

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited to do this challenge! Outlining what exactly I need to do vs what I want to do for this round was a surprisingly big effort, especially with writing detiled explanations for my objectives and house rules. Documenting stuff like this is one of the skills I'm hoping to improve by doing this challenge, so let's see how much I can do for these next 100 days!

### Day 1: Tuesday, May 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Set up the conda environment for the ZTM Machine Learning course, and started the Pandas Data Analysis section.

**Thoughts:** I think there's still a few small kinks to work out so that I can properly integrate different conda environments for different courses/projects into my VSCode workflows, but so far the one I created for the ML course has been working pretty well with minimal setup. I really love how I can put my notes and code together in one place using Jupyter Notebooks, and I certainly love being able to jump right in to working with Jupyter notebooks directly in VSCode!
