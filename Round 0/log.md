# 100 Days Of Code - Round 0 Log

### Day 0: Monday, May 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did some prep work for the 100 Days of Code challenge, outlined my objectives and set up some house rules for this round.

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited to do this challenge! Outlining what exactly I need to do vs what I want to do for this round was a surprisingly big effort, especially with writing detiled explanations for my objectives and house rules. Documenting stuff like this is one of the skills I'm hoping to improve by doing this challenge, so let's see how much I can do for these next 100 days!

### Day 1: Tuesday, May 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Set up the conda environment for the ZTM Machine Learning course, and started the Pandas Data Analysis section.

**Thoughts:** I think there's still a few small kinks to work out so that I can properly integrate different conda environments for different courses/projects into my VSCode workflows, but so far the one I created for the ML course has been working pretty well with minimal setup. I really love how I can put my notes and code together in one place using Jupyter Notebooks, and I certainly love being able to jump right in to working with Jupyter notebooks directly in VSCode!

### Day 2: Thursday, May 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed and added notes for the the Singly Linked List section in the JS Data Structures course.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE/PEP TALK:** I Intentionally skipped a day and immediately broke my streak to hopefully remind future me that at the end of the day, it's the skills that we learn thoughout these courses that matters, and not how many days straight we can make progress. To anyone reading this: If you're starting to feel tired or burnt out, feel free to take a day or two off and just relax, and come back to the code/lessons hopefully with renewed excitement to learn, improve your skills, and git gud!

Now going back to my thoughts on this day's progress:

**Thoughts:** Again, I believe that being able to write good documentation is one of the most valuable skills a developer should have, and I'm practicing that skill by writing notes as detailed as I can and providing some helpful comments in my code while I go along this Data Structures and Algorithms course. It's definitely a skill that I believe I can only get better at through sheer amounts of practice, so here's to a lot more notes like these being written as I progress through the course!

### Day 3: Friday, May 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Revisited the new WebDev Bootcamp update and went though the Node and Express basics section.

**Thoughts:** Node + Express feels like something I've been neglecting for quite a while now so it's nice to revisit these updated sections to refresh my knowledge and better prepare for the updated YelpCamp project. I feel this is gonna be great, especially because I plan on adding my own personal twist once I (re-)do the YelpCamp project!

### Day 4: Saturday, May 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Express+EJS Templating and RESTful Routing sections from the WebDev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Pretty big progress for this day! I'm definitely getting the hang of using Express JS and RESTful routing again. Just a couple more sections left and I can really (re-)start the new YelpCamp project!

### Day 5: Sunday, May 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the MongoDB and Mongoose sections from the WebDev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Another day of big progress! I've now caught up with (most of) what I need to know to get started with the YelpCamp project. I'm really excited to go through the revamped YelpCamp project sections next week!

### Day 6: Monday, May 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Pandas section lectures in the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** Don't let the 1hr38min video lengths for the Pandas section fool you, this course is super jam-packed with useful information and I noticed it took me more than 3-4hrs total simply coding along (without even adding the notes in) with the videos sped up to 1.5x ðŸ”¥

Even though I only planned to simply sit back and code along with the lectures today, my progress was actually a bit bigger than I planned! I'm excited to go through the exercises tomorrow!

### Day 7: Tuesday, May 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added my notes and completed the exercices on the Pandas section of the ZTM Machine Learning course.

**Thoughts:** My note-taking skills still leave a lot to be desired, and I hope to keep improving it as I code along with these lectures. The exercises themselves were a breeze to go through mostly thanks to me coding along with the lecture videos. However, one minor hiccup I encountered today was that my Jupyter kernel was apparently using the wrong environment and thus wasn't able to detect and import `pandas` properly. Note to self: Always double-check my Python environments before getting started to code!
