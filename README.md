# The Perpetual Testing Initiative

A collection of my attempts on the 100 Days of Code Challenge, with some fun(?) twists to help me keep being engaged and commited to the objectives at hand.

## Main Commitment

### _Create a compendium of knowledge, containing an easily accessible reference documenting the things I learn every step of the way._

## Current Status:

Round 1 - Started on February 1st, 2022

## Additional Rules

For each round, I'll try to add my own personal twists to the original rules of the 100 Days of Code challenge to suit my own objectives and goals. You can see my objectives and self-imposed challenges/rules in `house-rules.md` at each round's folder.
