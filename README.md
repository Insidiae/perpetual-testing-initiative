# The Perpetual Testing Initiative

A collection of my attempts on the 100 Days of Code Challenge, with some fun(?) twists to help me keep being engaged and commited to the objectives at hand.

## Main Commitment

### _Make progress every day, and try to keep that progress well-documented._

## Current Status:

Round 0 - Started on May 4th, 2021

## Additional Rules

For each round, I'll try to add my own personal twists to the original rules of the 100 Days of Code challenge to suit my own objectives and goals. You can see my objectives and self-imposed challenges/rules in `house-rules.md` at each round's folder.
